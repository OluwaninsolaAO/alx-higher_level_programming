# 0x0F Python - Object-relational mapping

My honest opinion about ORM is that it has a lot of levels of
abstrations to it, compared to using basic SQL query for CRUD
operations on a database, this section will explore in details
and hopefully open my eyes to why ORM will be a better choice
than good old SQL queries.

MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy will be explored in this section, while
I am rooting for MySQLdb for its simple and straight forward
approach, I hope SQLAlchemy will prove to be a better choice
by the end of this section.
