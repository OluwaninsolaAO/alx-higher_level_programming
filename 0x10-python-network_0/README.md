HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol used
by the World Wide Web to transfer data between servers and clients.
It is a request-response protocol in which clients send requests to
servers for web pages or other resources, and servers respond with
the requested data. HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that
each request and response is independent of previous requests and
responses. HTTP uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) as its
transport layer protocol and typically operates over port 80 or 443
for HTTPS (HTTP Secure) connections.
