# 0x04 Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

__Project Descriptor:__ Exploring Set and Dictionary Data Structures in
Python Programming Language introduces some more interesting way of collection,
processing of data to solve complex problems.

Set, more like a list but with a distinct attribute of ensuring each new element
to be added to the set is unique. While Dictionary is a key value pair type of
data structure, providing custom indexing in a list-like structure.

Other things explored in this section includes the use of lambda functions or
Annonymous functions, map, filter and reduce.


```
#!/usr/bin/python3
f = lambda x, y: x + y
map(f, map([range(1, 100, 12)])
```
