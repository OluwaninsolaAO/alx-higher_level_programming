# 0x12 Python Javascript Warm Up

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is widely used for developing interactive and dynamic web applications. It was created by Brendan Eich in just ten days in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation.

JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means that it runs in the user's browser rather than on a web server. This allows web developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages that can respond to user actions in real-time, without having to reload the entire page.

JavaScript has a syntax that is similar to other programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python. It supports various programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming.

In this section, the core functionalities of Javascript were explored.
