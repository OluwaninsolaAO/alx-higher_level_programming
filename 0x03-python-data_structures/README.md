# 0x03 Python - Data Structures: List, Tuples

__Project Descriptor:__ Unique to Python compared to C, data structures
includes lists and tuples, lists are simply a sequence of mutable values
separated by commas and often found enclosed inside ```[]```, a list can 
be defined or packed in multiple ways, one of which is what is known as 
comprehensive list. A list can be indexed and sliced same way as a string
laterral i.e. a list ```a = [1, 2, 3]``` can be indexed as ```a[0], a[1], a[2]```.

Tuples however, is a type of data structure that can hold lists of different
datatypes of any lenght, unlike lists - tuples are immutable, but a tuple can
contain a list of mutable values.


```
#!/usr/bin/python3
superpwr[] = [x**x for x in range(1,13)]
```
